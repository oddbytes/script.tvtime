# script.tvtime

Kodi plugin for [TV Time](http://www.tvtime.com)

This plugin will set TV shows episodes you've seen as watched on TV Time.
It will also add the new TV show to your account if it was not already there.

This fork has been created to be able to apply some fixes on the initial repository (hibernating/dead) but it will never be submitted to the official Kodi repository. Thanks cxii-dev , alxlaxv and all the other contributors.

This version is mantained just for my personal use. If it works for you, you are welcomed to use it but if it doesn't please don't require me to fix bugs or enhance it. Unfortunately i don't have the time to do it.
